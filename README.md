# FatPressor

**Tube-Driven Optical Compressor**

---

FatPressor transforms thin, digital-sounding tracks into warm, rich, and full-bodied audio. Inspired by classic tube compressors, it delivers that sought-after analog character with a modern, intuitive interface.

Whether you're working on vocals, drums, bass, or your mix bus, FatPressor brings the warmth and glue that makes records sound like records.

## The FAT Knob

The heart of FatPressor is the **FAT** control — a single knob that dials in tube harmonics, optical warmth, and transformer coloration all at once.

- **0%** — Clean compression, no coloration
- **50%** — Subtle warmth and presence
- **100%** — Full butter saturation, that "expensive analog" sound

No need to tweak multiple parameters. Just turn up FAT until it sounds right.

## Quick Start

3. **Turn up FAT** to add warmth (start around 30-50%)
4. **Adjust Output** to match your original level
5. **Tweak Mix** if you want parallel compression

That's it. Trust your ears.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Vocals**: Start with "Gentle Lead" preset, increase FAT for more presence
- **Drums**: Use slower attack (20-40ms) to let transients punch through
- **Bass**: The FAT control adds harmonics that help bass translate on small speakers
- **Mix Bus**: Keep it subtle — 1-3 dB of gain reduction with FAT around 20-40%
- **Parallel Compression**: Drop Mix to 30-50% and compress harder for weight without squash
